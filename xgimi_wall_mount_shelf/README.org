I would like to have a shelf near to the wall-mounted xgimi projector to hold
its cable and power brick, a Nvidia Shield TV and potentially a Nintendo Switch
dock.

For that purpose, I found a nicely extensible shelf:

Since I don't want to drill holes in the wall. The plan to to use the existing
wall mount and fix the shelf to it with a zip tie.

However, the model here is not big enough to hold the power brick. In this
folder, I create a customizable side wall of the shelf so that it can be
arbitrarily large.
